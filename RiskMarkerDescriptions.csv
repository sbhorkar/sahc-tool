,,
LDL,"High LDL leads to plaque buildup in arteries, causing narrowing and increasing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular disease.","Eat fiber-rich foods, reduce unhealthy fats, exercise regularly, manage stress, quit smoking, and monitor LDL. Medications (e.g., statins) may help."
HDL,"Low HDL impairs cholesterol removal and reduces anti-inflammatory protection, increasing heart disease and diabetes risk.","Engage in aerobic/HIIT exercise, consume healthy fats (nuts, olive oil, fish), eat fiber-rich foods (whole grains, vegetables), avoid trans fats and refined carbs, and quit smoking."
Total Cholesterol,"A combined measure of LDL, HDL, and 20% of triglycerides. High levels indicate an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.","Exercise regularly, eat fiber-rich foods, and use medication if necessary to maintain healthy cholesterol levels."
Triglycerides,"High levels increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, insulin resistance, pancreatitis, and metabolic syndrome, which raises diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk.","Exercise (150 min/week), reduce sugar/refined carbs, increase fiber and healthy fats (nuts, olive oil, fish), limit alcohol, and use medication if needed."
Total Cholesterol to HDL ratio,"A high ratio indicates an imbalance of good vs. bad cholesterol, increasing the risk of plaque buildup, atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke.","Eat heart-healthy foods (increase healthy fats and soluble fiber, reduce saturated and trans fats, limit sugar and refined carbs), exercise (150 min/week), quit smoking, and limit alcohol."
Fasting Glucose,"High levels indicate poor glucose regulation, raising the risk of prediabetes, diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and oxidative stress.","Improve with high-fiber foods, hydration, reduced refined carbs, regular exercise, stress management, quality sleep, and weight management."
HbA1c,"High levels indicate prolonged high blood sugar, damaging blood vessels, nerves, and organs. Raises the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage.","Exercise (150 min/week), post-meal walks, eat a balanced diet (vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats), limit sugar and refined carbs, monitor blood sugar, manage stress and sleep, and adhere to medication if needed."
Body Mass Index,"Higher BMI in South Asians is linked to increased metabolic disorders, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, hypertension, and heart disease.","Lower BMI gradually with a balanced diet, regular exercise, increased daily movement, proper sleep, stress management, hydration, and realistic goal-setting."
Systolic Blood Pressure,"High SBP damages blood vessels, overworks the heart, hardens arteries, and contributes to insulin resistance, increasing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, and diabetes.","Eat a heart-healthy diet, reduce sodium, exercise regularly, quit smoking, limit alcohol, lose weight if needed, and manage stress."
Diastolic Blood Pressure,"High DBP increases strain on the heart and arteries, leading to stiff arteries, reduced blood flow, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.","Exercise regularly, follow the DASH diet, reduce salt and increase potassium, limit alcohol/caffeine, quit smoking, manage stress, and use medications if needed."
